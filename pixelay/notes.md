Pixelay Notes — Differences from Figma

Header / Navigation

In the Figma design, there’s a “Get Started” button next to the hamburger menu on mobile — I didn’t include this button.

Hero Section

Minor font size differences in the hero headline and subtext (slightly smaller than Figma).

Features Section

I implemented the arrow navigation, but didn’t include the pagination indicator (e.g. “1/4”) shown in the Figma design.

Design Fidelity Approach

Since the scope was homepage only, I focused on mirroring the design closely.

Used Figma Inspect tool + Chrome DevTools to verify colors and fonts against the Figma file.
